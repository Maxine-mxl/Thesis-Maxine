# Thesis-Maxine
This repository contains all the files and code used for the Data analysis thesis of Maxine Lelasseux. 

In the 'Code' folder you can find the code to transform a data file into a binary coded data file (this code is written in R by Dr. K.L. Syme). Other code files in this file are: the code to determine clusters in data (row-based and column-based), code to do all the analyses done during this research and the code used to group all the OCM codes together in self-determined groups.  

In the 'Data for analyses' folder you can find the four data files used to do the analyses with. 

In the 'Original data' folder you can find the two original data files given at the beginning of this project. The offenses against life data file was used to create the four data files that were used to analyses with (which can be found in the 'Data for analyses' folder). 

Lastly four .png files were uploaded, these are the images of the plots created when doing the cluster analyses. A table with the frequencies of the OCM codes can be found in the OCM_codes_frequencies.xlsx file and the Google Colab Notebook used during this research was uploaded and can be found when clicking on 'Thesis_Maxine.ipynb'. 

Enjoy!
