64,"Klamath","NR10","North America","Oregon","The Klamath are Native Americans living in southwestern Oregon. Traditionally, the Klamath were fishers, gatherers, and hunters. On the reservation, the Klamath added stock raising and logging to their economic pursuits. Off the reservation, day labor, particularly farm work, became more important. Unlike many other groups, the Klamath did not suffer from European-introduced epidemic diseases or from hostilities with Euro-American settlers. In 1864 the Klamath entered into a treaty with the Federal government, ceding most of their aboriginal land in return for the more than one million acre Klamath Reservation.

The Klamath, who call themselves ""Maklaks,"" are an American Indian ethnic group located in southwestern Oregon. They are closely related to the neighboring Modoc Indians, and display a number of cultural features typical of both the Plateau and Northwest Coast regions. The cultural position of the Klamath was the subject of much debate among the authors of the 1930s, when tracing origins and the diffusion of cultural elements was a primary concern of anthropologists. This debate never resulted in any definitive conclusions. It is sufficient to know that features from cultures in the Plateau and the Northwest Coast regions, as well as, the Great Basin and California are present among the Klamath. Originally, the Klamath-Modoc lived in the marshy and riverine upland country in what is today southern Oregon and northern California, occupying a region of approximately 20 million acres. Today, the Klamath Reservation is located in Klamath County, Oregon, at approximately 121 to 122 degrees west longitude and 42 to 43 degrees north latitude (For a map of Klamath Reservation and surrounding peoples, see Stern 1965, 279.)

The Cherokee are Iroquoian-speaking people, and the Cherokee language is related to the languages spoken by the Mohawk, Seneca, Cayuga, Oneida, Onondaga, and Tuscarora. In early times, Cherokees were divided geographically and linguistically into Upper Towns, Lower Towns, and Middle Towns, with each speaking a different dialect of the language (Fitzgerald & Conley, 2002) The Atali, Elati, and Kituhwa dialects were spoken respectively in the Upper Towns, Lower Towns, and Middle Towns (Pritzker, 2000). In 1821, Sequoyah (George Guess), after twelve years, created a Cherokee syllabary, a writing system comprised of 85 characters representing all the sounds in the Cherokee language. The syllabary was widely accepted and allowed the Cherokee Nation to have a written constitution, a newspaper and become literate (Fitzgerald & Conley, 2002, Waldman, 1999).",0,"35.60371874069731,-80.859375","","2013-07-08 13:33:14.953573","2013-07-25 23:35:34.960693",4

These tribes engaged in an intertribal system of trade, marriage, feasting, and raiding, and spoke the Chinook jargon. The extinct Quinault language was in the Salishan family. Since their relocation to the Quinault Indian Reservation, the name Quinault is associated with all the Indians who live on the Reservation, regardless of their historical tribal affiliations. The contemporary Quinault have a common identity based on shared residency and the collective struggle for control over their natural resources. In 1975 the Quinault reorganized their government and ratified the Constitution of the Quinault Indian Nation.

The Yurok live on the northwest coast of California and on the lower Klamath River. Traditional subsistence was based on fishing, hunting, and gathering, with salmon being the most important food source. Yurok society was socially stratified into ""aristocrats"", ""commoners"", and the ""poor"". There were no chiefs or leaders, although a man could sometimes gain importance through great wealth.

The Comanche had large herds of horses and they used them for hunting, raiding, trade, and occasionally for food in difficult times. The headquarters of the Comanche Nation is in southwest Oklahoma, centered around Lawton.

The name Comanche entered English from Spanish, derived from a Ute term signifying ""other."" The Siouan Padouca was applied by the French and the Americans to Comanches and Apaches in the 1700s and 1800s. Ietan, usually considered a derivative of Ute, also appears in French sources.

The historical Comanches occupied the southern Great Plains grasslands across southeastern Colorado, eastern New Mexico, western Oklahoma, and western Texas. Some traveled widely beyond this range. In the year 2000 the tribal headquarters was north of Lawton, Oklahoma; tribal members lived in this vicinity and in several U.S. cities.

They are not culturally homogeneous and the differences between local Miao cultures are often as great as between Miao and non-Miao neighbors. The term ""Miao"" is Chinese, and means ""weeds"" or ""sprouts."" Chinese minority policies since the 1950s treat these diverse groups as a single nationality and associate them with the San Miao Kingdom of central China mentioned in histories of the Han dynasty (200 BC-AD 200).

About half of China's Miao are located in Guizhou Province. Another 34 percent are evenly divided between Yunnan Province and western Hunan Province. The remainder are mainly found in Sichuan and Guangxi, with a small number in Guangdong and Hainan. Some of the latter may have been resettled there during the Qing dynasty. The wide dispersion makes it difficult to generalize about ecological settings. Miao settlements are found anywhere from a few hundred meters above sea level to elevations of 1,400 meters or more.  The largest number are uplands people, often living at elevations over 1,200 meters and located at some distance from urban centers or the lowlands and river valleys where the Han are concentrated. Often, these upland villages and hamlets are interspersed with those of other minorities such as Yao, Dong, Zhuang, Yi, Hui, and Bouyei.

166,"Yi","AE04","East Asia","China","The Yi are one of the largest minority groups in China. They are uplands farmers and pastoralists. Most live in Sichuan and Yunnan provinces, in the areas of the Greater and Lesser Liangshan mountain ranges, at elevations ranging from 2,000 meters to 3,000 or 3,500 meters above sea level. The main areas of settlement lie south of the Dadu River and along the Anning River. Altitude and access to water varies, making for differences in economic activities in various areas.

The Yi languages belong to the Tibeto-Burman branch of Sino-Tibetan. There are six distinct dialects. The Yi have a syllabic script developed in the thirteenth century or earlier, which has been replaced with a reformed writing system in recent times.

The Yi share common ancestry with other ethnic groups such as the Bai, Naxi, Lahu, and Lisu of Yunnan, and seem also to be related to the Di and Qiang peoples of western Sichuan. Between the second century BC. and the early Christian era, the forerunners of the Yi made their appearance in the areas of Dianchi (present-day Kunming) in Yunnan and Chengdu in Sichuan.",0,"30.651652,104.075931","","2013-07-08 13:33:18.131389","2013-07-08 13:33:18.133133",4

During the late twentieth century, many Tuareg have migrated to rural and urban areas farther south—into Sahelian and coastal regions of West Africa—because of drought, famine, and political tensions with the central governments of Mali and Niger. Since the early 1990s, some Tuareg have joined an armed insurrection against those governments (Bourgeot 1990, 129-162). A few Tuareg have emigrated to France. The Saharan and Sahelian regions of Mali and Niger, where most Tuareg still live are the principal biomes to which the culture is adapted (Baier and Lovejoy 1977; Bernus 1981).",0,"20.632784250388028,5.625","also West Africa","2013-07-08 13:33:26.035021","2013-07-26 01:09:59.234607",4
238,"Turkana","FL17","East Africa","Kenya","“Turkana” is the name given to the pastoral and formerly pastoral people living in the arid and semiarid rangelands of northwestern Kenya. The Turkana refer to themselves as “Ngiturkan” and their land as “Eturkan.” The Turkana ethnic group as a whole is composed of two major divisions, and each division composed of territorial sections. The major divisions are the Ngimonia and the Ngichoro; Ngimonia are divided into Ngissir and non-Ngissir sections. The sections of the Ngichuro division are: Ngilukumong, Ngiwoyakwara, Ngigamatak, Ngibelai, and Ngibotok. The sections of the Ngimonia division are Ngikwatela, Ngiyapakuno, Ngissiger, Ngijie, Ngissir, Ngibocheros, Ngiseto, Ngisonyoka, Ngimazuk, Ngatunyo, Nganyagatauk, Ngikuniye, Ngikajik, and Ngimamong. Each section is identified with an area in Eturkan, but the extent to which the sectional territory is occupied exclusively by members of the section varies according to the rules governing natural-resource use of that particular section. The area occupied by the Turkana people corresponds closely with the current boundaries of Turkana District in Kenya. It lies between 1°30' and 5°00' N and encompasses approximately 67,000 square kilometers. Eturkan lies entirely within the Gregory Rift Valley and is bordered to the west by the Rift Valley wall, to the north by the mountains and plains occupied by the Taposa of southern Sudan, to the east by the western shoreline of Lake Turkana, and to the south by the plains inhabited by the pastoral Pokot.",0,"None,None","","2013-07-08 13:33:26.075735","2013-07-08 13:33:26.077381",4
